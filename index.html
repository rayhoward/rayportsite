         My First project was made using <span class="arduino">Arduino</span>; a decorative stop light
        that would be recoded to act as a stop light with random generated
        time effecting when the lights would turn on and off.
        My Experience with <span class="arduino">Arduino</span> has been limited due to cost restraints
        keeping me from being able to work on projects, but, I have the ideas
         and sketches for many projects I would like to pursue in the future.
         Id say I am competent with this stack, though my exposure is limited my grasp of
         the style is good enough to continue with my future projects.

            Wondering what my experience with <span class="htmlcssjs">HTML/CSS/JS</span>? Well you're looking at it!
            My first delve into these languages was creating this portfolio site at the suggestion of a friend.
            I have plans for more <span class="htmlcssjs">HTML/CSS/JS</span> projects starting with a Blackjack
            code that impliments a streamlined way to learn how to count cards (for non cheating use), inspired 
            by my viewing of the movie '21'. I'd say I am a beginner with this stack and able to and will be learning
            more.
            <div><button data-close-button class="close-button" style="color: lightgrey;">(click to close)</button></div>
           </div>
           <div id="overlay"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="modal java-border" id="project-java">
            <div class="modal-header java-bottom">
                <div class="title java">HTML/CSS/JS</div>

             <div class="modal-body">
            When it comes to <span class="java">Java</span> you're going to have to trust me. I took the AP Com Sci
            VLACS class my senior year of high school (2021) and unfortunately all the projects I had worked on are
            gone as my laptop that I used during these times was wiped. That being said it taught me my foundational
            knowledge on coding and sent me on the path to where I am today. Id say I have more to learn with this stack
            but am very familiar.
